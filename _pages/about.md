I am **Milad Mohammadi**, an M.Sc. candidate in **IT Engineering** at the *University of Tehran* and an **AI Software Engineer** specializing in **Language Agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Digital Mental Health applications**.
My research sits at the intersection of **AI engineering and cognitive science**, focusing on:

* Building clinically responsible multi-agent systems for mental health assessment and diagnosis.
* Applying psychological and cognitive theories to improve AI agent behavior, safety, and interpretability.

I have contributed to both **academic research** (e.g., benchmarking LLMs, multi-agent system design, cognitive modeling) and **industry-scale AI products**, including **banking chatbots, intelligent retrieval systems, and automated knowledge ingestion pipelines**.

Outside research and engineering, I have served as a **teaching assistant** for multiple graduate-level AI/NLP courses, organized large-scale workshops, and volunteered in academic and community initiatives such as **TEDx** and the **ACM Student Chapter**.

If you are interested in collaboration or discussion, feel free to [contact me via email](mailto:mohammadi.milad.mim@gmail.com).
